All the codes of DAA, Machine Learning and Block Chain Technology

*Digital Analysis of Algorithms*

1. Write a program non-recursive and recursive program to calculate Fibonacci numbers and
analyze their time and space complexity.
2. Write a program to implement Huffman Encoding using a greedy strategy.
3. Write a program to solve a fractional Knapsack problem using a greedy method.
4. Write a program to solve a 0-1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming or branch and
bound strategy.
5. Design n-Queens matrix having first Queen placed. Use backtracking to place remaining
Queens to generate the final n-queen’s matrix.
6. Write a program for analysis of quick sort by using deterministic and randomized variant

*Machine Learning*

1. Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location.
Perform following tasks:
1. Pre-process the dataset.
2. Identify outliers.
3. Check the correlation.
4. Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.
5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

2. Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has two
states: a) Normal State – Not Spam, b) Abnormal State – Spam. Use K-Nearest Neighbors and
Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their performance.

3. Implement Gradient Descent Algorithm to find the local minima of a function.
For example, find the local minima of the function y=(x+3)² starting from the point x=2.

4. Implement K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on diabetes.csv dataset. Compute confusion
matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision and recall on the given dataset.

*BlockChain Technology*

1. Installation of MetaMask and study spending Ether per transaction

2. Create your own wallet using Metamask for crypto transactions.

3. Write a smart contract on a test network, for Bank account of a customer for following
operations:
• Deposit money
• Withdraw Money
• Show balance

4. Write a program in solidity to create Student data. Use the following constructs:
• Structures
• Arrays
• Fallback
Deploy this as smart contract on Ethereum and Observe the transaction fee and Gas values
