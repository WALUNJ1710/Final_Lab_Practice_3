    "## Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import required libraries:\n",
    "   - `heapq`: This library provides a priority queue (min heap) for efficient tree construction in Huffman coding.\n",
    "   - `collections`: It is used to count the frequency of characters in the input data.\n",
    "   - `time`: This library is used to measure the execution time of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the `HuffmanNode` class:\n",
    "   - This class represents a node in the Huffman tree. Each node has the following attributes:\n",
    "     - `char`: The character associated with the node (None for internal nodes).\n",
    "     - `freq`: The frequency of the character.\n",
    "     - `left`: The left child of the node.\n",
    "     - `right`: The right child of the node.\n",
    "   - The `__lt__` method is defined to compare nodes based on their frequencies. This is used in the priority queue for sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define the `build_huffman_tree` function:\n",
    "   - This function builds the Huffman tree from the input data.\n",
    "   - It counts the frequency of each character in the data.\n",
    "   - Creates a min-heap (priority queue) of `HuffmanNode` objects based on character frequencies.\n",
    "   - Repeatedly combines the two lowest-frequency nodes into a new internal node with their frequencies as the sum until only one node (the root) remains in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the `build_huffman_codes` function:\n",
    "   - This function generates Huffman codes for each character in the tree.\n",
    "   - It traverses the tree and assigns binary codes (0 for left, 1 for right) to characters.\n",
    "   - The codes are stored in a dictionary where the character is the key and the code is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Define the `huffman_encoding` function:\n",
    "   - This function takes the input data and performs Huffman encoding.\n",
    "   - It calls `build_huffman_tree` to build the Huffman tree.\n",
    "   - It then calls `build_huffman_codes` to generate Huffman codes for each character.\n",
    "   - Encodes the original data using the generated codes.\n",
    "   - Returns the encoded data and the root of the Huffman tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Define the `huffman_decoding` function:\n",
    "   - This function takes the encoded data and the Huffman tree root and performs decoding.\n",
    "   - It starts at the root and follows the binary code in the encoded data to traverse the tree.\n",
    "   - When it reaches a leaf node (character), it appends the character to the decoded data.\n",
    "   - Returns the decoded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Example usage:\n",
    "   - The code takes user input for the data to encode.\n",
    "   - Calls `huffman_encoding` to encode the data and `huffman_decoding` to decode it.\n",
    "   - It then prints the original data, encoded data, and decoded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Measures and prints the execution time of the program using the `time` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates the encoding and decoding of data using Huffman coding and measures the execution time of the operations."

    "The given code is a Python program that solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where you have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and you want to select a subset of items to maximize the total value while not exceeding a given capacity constraint.\n",
    "## Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `time` module and record the start time to measure the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the `knapsack_dynamic_programming` function:\n",
    "   - This function takes three parameters: `values`, `weights`, and `capacity`.\n",
    "   - `values`: A list of values associated with each item.\n",
    "   - `weights`: A list of weights associated with each item.\n",
    "   - `capacity`: The maximum weight the knapsack can hold.\n",
    "   - The function uses dynamic programming to find the optimal solution for the knapsack problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the function:\n",
    "   - Create a 2D table `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (capacity+1)`, where `n` is the number of items.\n",
    "   - Initialize the table with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fill the `dp` table using dynamic programming:\n",
    "   - Iterate through the items and the capacity.\n",
    "   - If either the current item is the first item (i = 0) or the current capacity is zero (w = 0), set `dp[i][w]` to 0 since there's no value to add.\n",
    "   - If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current capacity (`weights[i - 1] <= w`), choose the maximum value between:\n",
    "     - Adding the value of the current item to the value of the subproblem with one less item and reduced capacity (`values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]`).\n",
    "     - The value of the subproblem with the same number of items and the same capacity (`dp[i - 1][w]`).\n",
    "   - If the weight of the current item is greater than the current capacity, set `dp[i][w]` to the value of the subproblem with one less item (`dp[i - 1][w]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Backtrack to find the items included in the knapsack:\n",
    "   - Initialize an empty list `items` to store the selected items.\n",
    "   - Start from the last item and the maximum capacity.\n",
    "   - While the item index (`i`) and capacity (`j`) are greater than zero:\n",
    "     - If the value at `dp[i][j]` is different from the value at `dp[i - 1][j]`, it means that the current item was included.\n",
    "     - Add the index of the current item to the `items` list.\n",
    "     - Subtract the weight of the current item from the current capacity (`j`).\n",
    "     - Decrement the item index (`i`).\n",
    "   - Reverse the `items` list to maintain the original order of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate the execution time of the algorithm and return the maximum value, selected items, and execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Example usage:\n",
    "   - Input the number of items (`n`).\n",
    "   - Input the values and weights of each item.\n",
    "   - Input the capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "   - Call the `knapsack_dynamic_programming` function with the input data.\n",
    "   - Print the maximum value and the selected items.\n",
    "   - Record the end time and print the total execution time in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates how to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming and measures the execution time for a given set of items, values, weights, and capacity."

    "### Here's an explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `def print_mat(mat)`: This function is used to print the current state of the chessboard. It takes the chessboard matrix `mat` as input and prints it row by row, where 1s represent the positions of the queens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `def is_safe(mat, row, col)`: This function checks if it's safe to place a queen at a specific position (row, col) on the chessboard. It verifies that no other queen in the same column or along the diagonals threatens the current position. If it's safe, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `def n_queen(mat, row)`: This is the core recursive function that attempts to solve the N-Queens problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `mat`: The current state of the chessboard.\n",
    "   - `row`: The current row being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The function proceeds as follows:\n",
    "   - If `row` reaches the value of `n`, which is the size of the chessboard, it means that all queens have been successfully placed, and a solution has been found. It increments the `count` and prints the current chessboard as a solution.\n",
    "   - For each column in the current row, it checks if it's safe to place a queen there. If it's safe, it places a queen at that position, marks it as 1, and proceeds to the next row by making a recursive call with `row + 1`.\n",
    "   - After exploring all possibilities, it unmarks the position by setting it back to 0. This backtracking mechanism allows the algorithm to explore different configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Input for `n`: The user is prompted to input the number of queens (`n`) they want to place on the chessboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Initialize `mat`: A chessboard matrix `mat` is created as an NxN grid, initially filled with zeros. This matrix represents the chessboard, with 1s indicating the positions of the queens.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Initialize `count`: A global variable `count` is used to keep track of the number of solutions found. It is initialized to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The `n_queen` function is called with `mat` and `row` initially set to 0, effectively starting the process of finding solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After all solutions have been explored, the code checks if any solutions were found (`count > 0`). If solutions were found, it prints the total number of solutions. If no solutions were found, it indicates that there is no solution for the given value of `n`."

    "### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `quick_sort` function: This is the deterministic Quick Sort algorithm. It sorts an array of elements using a pivot strategy where the first element is chosen as the pivot. It recursively divides the array into two subarrays, one with elements less than or equal to the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot. The sorted subarrays are combined with the pivot element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `randomized_quick_sort` function: This is the randomized Quick Sort algorithm. It also sorts an array of elements but randomly selects the pivot element. The rest of the sorting process is similar to deterministic Quick Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `analyze_quick_sort` function: This function takes an array and a variant parameter (\"deterministic\" or \"randomized\") to analyze the Quick Sort variant. It records the start time, performs the sorting, records the end time, and calculates the execution time. It returns both the sorted array and the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Input: The program allows you to input the number of elements and the elements themselves for the array you want to sort. It then displays the given array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sorting and Analysis:\n",
    "   - The program calls `analyze_quick_sort` twice, once for the deterministic variant and once for the randomized variant.\n",
    "   - For each call, it records the sorted array and execution time.\n",
    "   - It then prints the sorted array and execution time for both variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Execution Time: The execution time is measured in seconds and is displayed with a precision of 6 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can use the code:\n",
    "- Run the program and input the number of elements and the elements for the array.\n",
    "- The program will perform both deterministic and randomized Quick Sorts on the input array and provide the sorted arrays and execution times for both variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is useful for comparing the performance of deterministic and randomized pivot selection strategies in Quick Sort for a given input dataset."

    "### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deterministic Quick Sort**: This is an implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm where the pivot element is chosen deterministically, typically as the first element of the array. The function divides the array into three parts: elements less than the pivot (left), elements greater than the pivot (right), and elements equal to the pivot (equal). The equal elements are added to the result without further sorting. The function then recursively applies Quick Sort to the left and right partitions and combines them with the equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Randomized Quick Sort**: This is another implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm, but in this case, the pivot element is chosen randomly from the array. The array is also divided into three parts: elements less than the pivot (left), elements greater than the pivot (right), and elements equal to the pivot (equal). As with the deterministic version, the equal elements are added to the result without further sorting. The function recursively applies Quick Sort to the left and right partitions and combines them with the equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **measure_execution_time** function: This function measures the execution time of a sorting algorithm. It takes a sorting function (either deterministic or randomized) and the array to sort as input. It records the start time, executes the sorting algorithm, records the end time, and calculates the execution time in seconds. It returns the sorted array and the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate Random List**: It generates a random list of 1000 integers between 1 and 10000. You can replace this with your own data or adjust the number of elements as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sorting and Execution Time Measurement**:\n",
    "   - It applies the deterministic Quick Sort and measures the execution time.\n",
    "   - It applies the randomized Quick Sort and measures the execution time.\n",
    "   - It prints the execution times for both algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Verification**: It checks if the two sorted arrays produced by the deterministic and randomized Quick Sorts are the same. If they are the same, it prints \"Correct\"; otherwise, it prints \"Wrong.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The code essentially demonstrates the two Quick Sort variants and compares their execution times, making it useful for performance analysis and verification."
